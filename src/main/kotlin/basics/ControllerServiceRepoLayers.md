# Interaction of Layers in a Spring Boot Project

In a typical Spring Boot project (or any similar framework), the controller, service, and repository layers work together to handle HTTP requests, perform business logic, and interact with the database. Here's a more detailed breakdown of how these layers typically interact:

## 1. Controller Layer
The controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning HTTP responses. It acts as the entry point for the application's RESTful API. The controller methods map HTTP requests to specific service methods.

## 2. Service Layer
The service layer contains the business logic of the application. It processes the data received from the controller, performs any necessary operations, and interacts with the repository layer to retrieve or persist data.

## 3. Repository Layer
The repository layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It contains methods for performing CRUD operations and other database-related tasks. The repository methods are called by the service layer.

## Example Flow
Let's walk through an example flow for creating a new task:

1. **HTTP Request**: A client sends a POST request to `/api/tasks` with a JSON body containing the task details.
2. **Controller**: The `TaskController` receives the request and calls the `createTask` method in the `TaskService`.
3. **Service**: The `TaskService` processes the task data and calls the `save` method in the `TaskRepository` to persist the task in the database.
4. **Repository**: The `TaskRepository` interacts with the database to save the task.
5. **Service**: The `TaskService` returns the saved task to the `TaskController`.
6. **Controller**: The `TaskController` returns the saved task as an HTTP response to the client.
