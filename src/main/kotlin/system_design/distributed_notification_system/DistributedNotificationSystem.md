# Distributed Notification System Design

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
- **Send notifications via multiple channels:** Email, SMS, Push.
- **Support priority-based notification delivery.**
- **Allow retry mechanisms for failed notifications.**
- **Handle high throughput (e.g., millions of notifications per day).**

### Non-Functional Requirements:
- **Scalability:** Support a growing number of users and notifications.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Retry and fallback mechanisms for failed services.
- **Low Latency:** Ensure timely delivery for high-priority messages.
- **Extensibility:** Add new notification channels (e.g., WhatsApp) with minimal changes.

## High-Level Architecture

### Producers:
- **API or services that generate notification requests.**
- **Include metadata like user ID, message content, and priority.**

### Message Queue:
- **Decouple producers and consumers using a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).**
- **Handle message ordering and retries.**

### Consumers:
- **Process notifications from the queue.**
- **Dispatch notifications to appropriate channel services (e.g., Email Service, SMS Service).**

### Channel Services:
- **Integrate with third-party APIs (e.g., Twilio for SMS, SMTP for emails, FCM for push notifications).**
- **Handle retries and rate limits for external providers.**

### Storage:
- **Log notification metadata (e.g., status, timestamp) for audit purposes.**
- **Store user preferences (e.g., preferred channels).**

This architecture ensures that the system is scalable, reliable, and extensible, meeting both functional and non-functional requirements.
