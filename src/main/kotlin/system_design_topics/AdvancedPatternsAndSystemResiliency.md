We focus on **advanced patterns** for system resiliency, including **deployment strategies** and **monitoring/logging**. These are key for keeping systems secure, reliable, and operational even during updates or failures.

### 1. **Security Protocols**

#### **1.1 HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**
- **What it is**: HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP that uses **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** to encrypt data sent between clients and servers, ensuring privacy and integrity.

- **Benefits**:
    - **Encryption**: Data is encrypted in transit, making it hard for unauthorized parties to intercept or alter.
    - **Data Integrity**: TLS protects against data tampering.
    - **Authentication**: Ensures clients communicate with the intended server through certificates.

#### Example:
When you log into a bank’s website, HTTPS encrypts your credentials and transaction details, ensuring they can’t be intercepted by attackers.

---

#### **1.2 Single Sign-On (SSO)**
- **What it is**: SSO is an authentication process that allows users to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. It’s commonly implemented using **OAuth**, **SAML**, or **OpenID Connect**.

- **How it Works**:
    1. The user authenticates with an identity provider (IDP), such as Google or Microsoft.
    2. The IDP issues a **token** to the user.
    3. The user presents the token to different services, granting them access without additional logins.

- **Benefits**:
    - **User Convenience**: Users need only one login for multiple services.
    - **Improved Security**: Centralizes authentication, enabling stronger security policies like multi-factor authentication (MFA).

#### Example:
With SSO, a user logged into their company’s IDP can access multiple internal applications (email, CRM, etc.) without logging into each individually.

### 2. **Deployment Strategies**

#### **2.1 Blue-Green Deployment**
- **What it is**: Blue-green deployment is a strategy for minimizing downtime and risk during releases. It uses two identical environments—**blue** (current version) and **green** (new version). Traffic is switched from blue to green once the new version is ready.

- **How it Works**:
    1. Deploy the new version in the **green environment**.
    2. Run tests in the green environment to ensure stability.
    3. Route traffic from **blue to green** once verified.
    4. Keep the blue environment as a rollback option if issues arise.

- **Benefits**:
    - **Minimized Downtime**: No downtime during deployment.
    - **Easy Rollback**: Quickly switch back to the blue environment if there are issues.

#### Example:
E-commerce platforms often use blue-green deployment to release updates without interrupting live users, ensuring the new version works before making it public.

---

#### **2.2 Canary Releases**
- **What it is**: A canary release is a strategy that gradually rolls out new versions to a small subset of users first (canaries) before a full release. It enables testing of the new version in a live environment with minimal risk.

- **How it Works**:
    1. Release the update to a small group of users (1-5% of traffic).
    2. Monitor the update’s performance and gather feedback.
    3. If successful, gradually increase the number of users receiving the new version.
    4. Roll back if issues arise before reaching a full release.

- **Benefits**:
    - **Early Issue Detection**: Identifies issues on a small scale.
    - **Controlled Rollout**: Allows developers to observe real-world impact before a full deployment.

#### Example:
Streaming services might use canary releases to test a new video compression algorithm. By deploying it to a small group, they can assess quality and performance without affecting all users.

### 3. **Monitoring and Logging**

Monitoring and logging provide visibility into system health, enabling teams to detect issues early and respond quickly. Effective monitoring and logging are essential for understanding how systems perform over time and identifying bottlenecks or failures.

---

#### **3.1 Metrics**

Metrics capture **quantitative data** on system performance and resource usage, which can be used to set alerts and thresholds.

- **Types of Metrics**:
    - **System Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic.
    - **Application Metrics**: Request rate, error rate, latency, database query time.
    - **Business Metrics**: Metrics specific to business logic, such as the number of completed purchases or sign-ups.

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**:
    - **Latency**: Measures the time taken for requests to complete. High latency may indicate performance issues.
    - **Throughput**: Measures the number of requests handled per second, showing the system’s capacity.
    - **Error Rate**: Tracks failed requests or errors. High error rates often indicate critical issues.

#### Example:
In a web application, metrics like latency, error rate, and CPU usage are tracked continuously to identify slowdowns, bottlenecks, or errors that might affect user experience.

---

#### **3.2 Alerting Systems**

An alerting system notifies engineers when metrics cross predefined thresholds, enabling a quick response to issues before they impact users.

- **Types of Alerts**:
    - **Threshold Alerts**: Triggered when a metric crosses a set threshold (e.g., CPU usage above 80%).
    - **Anomaly Detection**: Uses machine learning or statistical models to detect unusual patterns in metrics.
    - **Event-Based Alerts**: Triggered by specific events, such as server downtime or an error spike.

- **Alert Routing**:
    - Alerts can be routed based on severity and type, directing critical alerts to on-call engineers and non-critical ones to support teams.

#### Example:
In a banking application, alerts are set to notify engineers if response time exceeds a threshold, signaling potential performance issues or security risks that need immediate attention.

### Example System: Rolling Out a New Feature for a Social Media Platform

Imagine we’re rolling out a new **user recommendation engine** for a social media platform using the strategies and tools we’ve discussed.

1. **Security**:
    - **HTTPS** secures all data in transit to protect user privacy.
    - **SSO** allows users to authenticate through trusted identity providers, such as Google or Facebook, for convenience and security.

2. **Deployment Strategy**:
    - Use a **canary release** to gradually roll out the recommendation engine to a small group of users.
    - Monitor engagement and error rates closely. If no issues arise, incrementally increase the user base until it’s fully deployed.
    - Roll back to the previous recommendation system if error rates increase.

3. **Monitoring and Logging**:
    - **Metrics**: Track the latency and success rate of recommendations generated. Monitor the recommendation algorithm’s effectiveness by tracking the click-through rate (CTR) and time spent on recommendations.
    - **Alerting**: Set up alerts for high latency, low CTR, or error spikes to catch issues early and prevent a negative user experience.
    - **Logging**: Capture logs for all recommendation requests, tracking parameters and outcomes for each, which will help diagnose any issues in the recommendation engine.
