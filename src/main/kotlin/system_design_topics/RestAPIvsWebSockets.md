# Key Differences Between REST APIs and WebSockets

The communication models, data transfer patterns, and typical use cases of REST APIs and WebSockets differ significantly:

## 1. Communication Model

- **REST API**: Follows a request-response model. The client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with data. Connections are closed after each interaction, requiring new connections for every request.
- **WebSockets**: Enables full-duplex communication, allowing both the client and server to send data to each other simultaneously over a persistent connection. Once established, the connection remains open for continuous communication.

## 2. Data Transfer

- **REST API**: Operates over HTTP/HTTPS, and each message is independent, carrying all the necessary information (headers, body, etc.). The data is typically sent in JSON or XML format.
- **WebSockets**: Once a WebSocket connection is open, messages can flow back and forth without the overhead of headers, making it more efficient for real-time updates. Data is usually transferred as text or binary frames.

## 3. Use Cases

- **REST API**: Best suited for stateless operations, where a client sends requests to fetch, update, delete, or create resources. Commonly used in web services like CRUD operations, static data retrieval, and non-real-time interactions.
- **WebSockets**: Ideal for real-time applications where low-latency communication is crucial, such as live chats, real-time gaming, financial tickers, and collaborative tools.

## 4. State

- **REST API**: Stateless, meaning the server does not store any client context between requests. Every request contains all the information needed to process it.
- **WebSockets**: Stateful, since the connection remains open, allowing the server to maintain a persistent connection with the client.

## 5. Efficiency

- **REST API**: Less efficient for real-time data exchange because each interaction involves opening and closing the connection, along with the overhead of HTTP headers.
- **WebSockets**: More efficient for continuous, real-time communication because the connection is kept alive, and there is less overhead after the initial handshake.

## 6. Connection Handling

- **REST API**: A new connection is established for each request, making it more suitable for infrequent data exchanges.
- **WebSockets**: Uses a long-lived connection, making it better suited for applications that require frequent data updates, like push notifications.

## 7. Security

- **REST API**: Built on top of HTTP/HTTPS, so it uses SSL/TLS for encryption and has mature support for authentication mechanisms like OAuth and API keys.
- **WebSockets**: Also supports SSL/TLS (WSS for secure WebSocket), but implementing authentication and managing security can be more complex since WebSockets donâ€™t natively support standard HTTP headers.

### Summary

- **Use REST API** for request-response operations like fetching resources, which do not require real-time interaction.
- **Use WebSockets** for real-time, low-latency communication where updates need to be continuously sent and received without re-establishing connections.
